# chetcorcos.com

deploy with surge.sh

- font (light and bold)
- better colors

- consistent headers for articles with links back to home page

- backward compatible urls with old chetcorcos.com

- move chetcorcos.com to old.chetcorcos.com and point surge to dns

- add more content
	- about
	- github repos and other music projects
	- resume
	- research, SAM, PGM

- better readmes? fix as many demo links as possible.
- code vs writing?
- consolidate writing with source code -- make sure they're in the same place
